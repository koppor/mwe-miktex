\section{Background (SM1)}\label{sec:background}
\emph{Purpose and scope}. The background chapter has multiple roles.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Preliminaries.} It has to provide all (and exactly the) information that is necessary to understand the methodological and technical parts of your work in the specific area of study. Assume as starting point another student in your degree who did not study the specific subject you are studying but has the task to understand your work. Which concepts, terms, definitions, etc. does the student have to know? Which formulas, symbols, etc. are standard in this topic? Only introduce definitions if you actually need them in any of the subsequent chapters.
    \item \emph{Related Work.} It has to provide a comprehensive discussion of all prior work in the area on this subject. Your discussion has to summarize these prior works and has to explain in which way the research question you are solving (\cref{sec:introduction:research-question}) has not bee solved yet because prior work had more limiting assumptions, addressed a different angle, their results are not complete etc. Depending on the subject you are studying, the related work part can be larger and warrant an entire chapter on its own, or be fully concluded within \cref{sec:introduction:state-of-art}.
    You can close the related work discussion by clarifying the positioning and formulation of your research question (SM2) in relation to all the prior work, making more explicit whether you address an existing research question under different premises or whether you work on a modified or completely new research question.
\end{itemize}
\section{Problem Exposition (optional)}\label{sec:problem-exposition}
\emph{Purpose and scope}. Introduce the problem context in more detail if \cref{sec:introduction:topic} does not provide all necessary information about the problem to follow the rest of the report. This can include further details on the data you studied, context assumptions and requirements, etc.
If you have to expose the problem in more detail here, then this chapter should also provide a more detailed explanation of research question and the method you are applying, i.e., you can now provide more concrete sub-problems compared to \cref{sec:introduction:research-question} more details for the method \cref{sec:introduction:method} because you now have explained the problem much better. A typical structure can be.
\subsection{Context/Business Understanding (SM1)}\label{sec:problem-exposition:context-understanding}
provide details
\subsection{Data Understanding (SM1)}\label{sec:problem-exposition:data-understanding}
provide details
\subsection{Detailed Research Questions (SM2)}\label{sec:problem-exposition:research-problems}
provide details based on \cref{sec:problem-exposition:context-understanding} and \ref{sec:problem-exposition:data-understanding}
\subsection{Detailed Method (SM3)}\label{sec:problem-exposition:research-method}
provide details based on \cref{sec:problem-exposition:context-understanding} and \ref{sec:problem-exposition:data-understanding}
\section{First Real Chapter addressing first Research Problem}\label{sec:problem1}
\emph{Purpose and scope}. After you stated research context (SM1), research problem (SM2), and research method (SM3) in \cref{sec:introduction} and possibly \cref{sec:problem-exposition}, the remainder of your entire report addresses execution (SM4), results (SM5), and interpretation (SM6). You usually do this by addressing various sub-problems again through scientific arguments following the 6 steps SM1-SM6.
Have a short chapter introduction that recalls and explains the first research problem of your thesis. The problem has to show up in the introduction in \cref{sec:introduction:research-question} or in \cref{sec:problem-exposition:research-problems} already. This provides the background (SM1) for this chapter while the first research problem of the thesis becomes the research question/hypothesis (SM2) for this chapter.
Next, explain in the chapter intro how you solve the research problem in this chapter by breaking it down in further sub-problems. By this, you outline the method (SM3) through which you are going to solve the problem of this chapter. This is necessary to give the reader guidance of what's to come in this chapter and how it fits into the thesis as a whole. Explain that you will address the first sub-problem in \cref{sec:problem1:subproblem1} and the second sub-problem in \cref{sec:problem1:subproblem2}, etc. The sections then provide the details for execution and results.
\subsection{First Sub-Problem}\label{sec:problem1:subproblem1}
\emph{The first paragraph describes the first sub-problem and develops the requirements a solution has to satisfy (SM2 for this section).} The requirements have to be based on the knowledge and reasoning developing in the preceding chapters and sections. Try to use an example to illustrate the problem and the desired properties of the solution. Check that every term/concept you use here has already been defined already in a previous section. If you cannot describe your problem without defining new terms, you may have to add another section before this one that develops the terms and concepts you need to explain the problem.
\emph{The second paragraph describes the method/approach how you address the problem (SM3 for this section).} Describe the method in a level of detail that allows another student to reproduce your steps.
Make use of appendices % (see \cref{sec:appendix1})
if certain details take too much space.
\emph{The third, fourth, and following paragraph provides details on applying the method or developing a new approach, i.e., execution (SM4) and may explain results (SM5)}, i.e. details on the steps needed to reproduce the results.
Results (SM5) can come in many forms, e.g., conceptual diagrams, algorithms, tables, charts, a list of articles from a literature research etc. You must reference them (``\cref{fig:my_label} shows...'') and describe the results in text. If you use diagrams, tables, or charts, you cannot expect the reader to know what to you expect them to see in a diagram, table or chart. Describe to them how to read these, explain the meaning of particular elements, point out special observations. But you may only describe the results you must not interpret them. Make use of appendices if certain details take too much space.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    %%%\includegraphics{/path/to/figure.pdf}
    \caption{A scientific figure that has to be explained in the text}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}
\emph{After describing the results, you may interpret them (SM6).} Here you can infer what a particular observation means (for you), how it can be applied, or what others can do with it. You must not write interpretations before completely describing your results. This is a common mistake done by most beginner writers. You want to quickly get to the point, which is the final finding or interpretation. But you forget that your reader does not understand yet what you are interpreting - they do not know yet what you do know. An interpretation can only be followed after all results have been described. The interpretation must be based on the written description only. Then you can be sure that your readers can follow your interpretation and reach the same conclusions as you have.
Ideally, your interpretation leads to the next sub-problem in \cref{sec:problem1:subproblem2}.
\subsection{Second Sub-Problem}\label{sec:problem1:subproblem2}
You now build on the solution to the first sub-problem of \cref{sec:problem1:subproblem1} (SM1) and recall second sub-problem (SM2, you detailed in the introduction of this chapter) and follow the same pattern as before (SM3-SM6).
Note that not all sections may not include all parts SM1-SM6 in all detail. Some sections do not require to repeatedly state the background (SM1) or the research problem (SM2) if they were already clearly defined in a previous section. Sometimes, a section is only dedicated to describing the method (SM3) and execution (SM4) and does not contain any results or interpretations. Sometimes results (SM5) and interpretations (SM6) only come in the evaluation chapter.
What is important for you when you are writing a scientific argument is not to slavishly have SM1-SM6 in each section explicitly, but that you are always fully aware of the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Which step of a scientific argument am I currently writing (SM1, SM2, ..., SM6)?
    \item Does the step that I am writing come in the right order, i.e., if you are writing about execution (SM4, e.g., details of building a model), is there a preceding paragraph or section that describes the method (SM3) and is that one preceded by a clear statement of the (sub-)problem addressed (SM2)?
    \item Are you really \emph{not} writing interpretation SM6 before SM5, SM4, or SM3?
    \item Is it clear to the reader which part of the scientific argument you are currently making?
\end{itemize}
\section{Second Real Chapter}\label{sec:sub-problem2}
Have a short chapter introduction that recalls what you already achieved in \cref{sec:problem1} and explain the second research problem of your thesis. The problem has to show up in the introduction in \cref{sec:introduction:research-question} or in \cref{sec:problem-exposition:research-problems} already. etc.
\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}
\emph{Purpose and scope}. The evaluation chapter should be the most formal and rigorously structured chapter of your thesis as the validity of your evaluation argument depends on it.
\subsection{Objective (SM2)}\label{sec:evaluation:objective}
Clearly state what you want to evaluate and what you want to measure.
\subsection{Setup (SM3)}\label{sec:evaluation:setup}
State which data, participants, tools, etc. you chose and why. Clearly state how you measure outcomes and how you compare them to baselines, reference groups, etc.
\subsection{Execution (SM4)}\label{sec:evaluation:execution}
Provide all details on the execution that are necessary to allows another person to reproduce your results at a later point.
\subsection{Results (SM5)}\label{sec:evaluation:results}
You only report the measurements. You must present and reference them (``\cref{fig:my_label2} shows...'') and describe the results in text. If you use diagrams, tables, or charts, you cannot expect the reader to know what to you expect them to see in a diagram, table or chart. Describe to them how to read these, explain the meaning of particular elements, point out special observations. But you may only describe the results you must not interpret them. Make use of appendices if certain details take too much space.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    %%%\includegraphics{/path/to/figure.pdf}
    \caption{Another scientific figure that has to be explained in the text}
    \label{fig:my_label2}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Discussion (SM6)}\label{sec:evaluation:discussion}
An interpretation can only be followed after all results have been described. The interpretation must be based on the written description in \cref{sec:evaluation:results} only. Then you can be sure that your readers can follow your interpretation and reach the same conclusions as you have.

This section contains hints on writing LaTeX.
It focuses on minimal examples, which can be directly adapted to the content
\subsection{Handling of paragraphs}
\begin{ltgexample}
One sentence per line.
This rule is important for the usage of version control systems.
A new line is generated with a blank line.
As you would do in Word:
New paragraphs are generated by pressing enter.
In LaTeX, this does not lead to a new paragraph as LaTeX joins subsequent lines.
In case you want a new paragraph, just press enter twice (!).
This leads to an empty line.
In word, there is the functionality to press shift and enter.
This leads to a hard line break.
The text starts at the beginning of a new line.
In LaTeX, you can do that by using two backslashes (\textbackslash\textbackslash).\\
This is rarely used.
Please do \textit{not} use two backslashes for new paragraphs.
For instance, this sentence belongs to the same paragraph, whereas the last one started a new one.
A long motivation for that is provided at \url{http://loopspace.mathforge.org/HowDidIDoThat/TeX/VCS/#section.3}.
\end{ltgexample}
\subsection{Notes separated from the text}
The package mindflow enables writing down notes and annotations in a way so that they are separated from the main text.
\begin{ltgexample}
\begin{mindflow}
This is a small note.
\end{mindflow}
\end{ltgexample}
\subsection{Hyphenation}
\LaTeX{} automatically hyphenates words.
When using microtype, there should be less hypnetations than in other settings.
It might be necessary to tweak the hyphenations nevertheless.
Here are some hints:
\begin{ltgexample}
In case you write \enquote{application-specific}, then the word will only be hyphenated at the dash.
You can also write \verb1applica\allowbreak{}tion-specific1 (result: applica\allowbreak{}tion-specific), but this is much more effort.
You can now write words containing hyphens which are hyphenated at other places in the word.
For instance, \verb1application"=specific1 gets application"=specific.
This is enabled by an additional configuration of the babel package.
\end{ltgexample}
\subsection{Typesetting Units}
\begin{ltgexample}
Numbers can written plain text (such as 100), by using the siunitx package like that:
\SI{100}{\km\per\hour},
or by using plain \LaTeX{} (and math mode):
$100 \frac{\mathit{km}}{h}$.
\end{ltgexample}
\begin{ltgexample}
\SI{5}{\percent} of \SI{10}{kg}
\end{ltgexample}
\begin{ltgexample}
Numbers are automatically grouped: \num{123456}.
\end{ltgexample}
\subsection{Surrounding Text by Quotes}
\begin{ltgexample}
Please use the \enquote{enquote command} to quote something.
Quoting with "`quote"' or ``quote'' also works.
\end{ltgexample}
\subsection{Cleveref examples}
\label{sec:ex:cref}
Cleveref demonstration: Cref at beginning of sentence, cref in all other cases.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.75\linewidth]{example-image-a}
    \caption{Example figure for cref demo}
    \label{fig:ex:cref}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
      \toprule
      Heading1 & Heading2 \\
      \midrule
      One      & Two      \\
      Thee     & Four     \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Example table for cref demo}
    \label{tab:ex:cref}
\end{figure}
\begin{ltgexample}
\Cref{fig:ex:cref} shows a simple fact, although \cref{fig:ex:cref} could also show something else.
\Cref{tab:ex:cref} shows a simple fact, although \cref{tab:ex:cref} could also show something else.
\Cref{sec:ex:cref} shows a simple fact, although \cref{sec:ex:cref} could also show something else.
\end{ltgexample}
\subsection{Figures}
\begin{ltgexample}
\Cref{fig:label} shows something interesting.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{example-image-golden}
  \caption[Simple Figure]{Simple Figure. Based on \citet{mwe}.}
  \label{fig:label}
\end{figure}
\end{ltgexample}
One can span a figure across multiple columns by using \verb+\begin{figure*}+.
See \cref{fig:16x9} as an example.
\begin{ltgexample}
\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  % note that \textwidth is used instead of \linewidth
  % This ensures that the graphics width is 60% of the "page" (text block), and not just 60% of the current text column
  % See https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/17085/9075 for details
  \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{example-image-16x9}
  \caption{16x9 Figure}
  \label{fig:16x9}
\end{figure*}
\end{ltgexample}
\subsection{Sub Figures}
An example of two sub figures is shown in \cref{fig:two_sub_figures}.
\begin{ltgexample}
\begin{figure*}[!b]
    \centering
    \subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=.4\linewidth]{example-image-a}%
    \label{fig:first_case}}
  \hfil
    \subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=.4\linewidth]{example-image-b}%
    \label{fig:second_case}}
  \caption{Example figure with two sub figures.}
  \label{fig:two_sub_figures}
\end{figure*}
\end{ltgexample}
\subsection{Tables}
Note that IEEE does not support \verb+\begin{table}+, one has to use \verb+\begin{figure}+.
\begin{ltgexample}
\begin{figure}
  \caption{Simple Table}
  \label{tab:simple}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \toprule
    Heading1 & Heading2 \\
    \midrule
    One      & Two      \\
    Thee     & Four     \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{figure}
\end{ltgexample}
\begin{ltgexample}
\begin{figure}
\caption{Table with diagonal line}
\label{tab:diag}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\diagbox[width=10em]{Diag\\Column Head I}{Diag Column\\Head II} & Second & Third \\
\hline
& foo & bar \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{ltgexample}
\subsection{Source Code}
\begin{ltgexample}
\Cref{lst:XML} shows source code written in XML.
\Cref{line:comment} contains a comment.
\begin{lstlisting}[
  language=XML,
  caption={Example XML Listing},
  label={lst:XML}]
<listing name="example">
  <!-- comment --> (* \label{line:comment} *)
  <content>not interesting</content>
</listing>
\end{lstlisting}
\end{ltgexample}
One can also add \verb+float+ as parameter to have the listing floating.
\Cref{lst:flXML} shows the floating listing.
\begin{ltgexample}
\begin{lstlisting}[
  % one can adjust spacing here if required
  % aboveskip=2.5\baselineskip,
  % belowskip=-.8\baselineskip,
  float,
  language=XML,
  caption={Example XML listing -- placed as floating figure},
  label={lst:flXML}]
<listing name="example">
  Floating
</listing>
\end{lstlisting}
\end{ltgexample}
One can also typeset JSON as shown in \cref{lst:json}.
\begin{ltgexample}
\begin{lstlisting}[
  float,
  language=json,
  caption={Example JSON listing -- placed as floating figure},
  label={lst:json}]
{
  key: "value"
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{ltgexample}
Java is also possible as shown in \cref{lst:java}.
\begin{ltgexample}
\begin{lstlisting}[
  caption={Example Java listing},
  label=lst:java,
  language=Java,
  float]
public class Hello {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{ltgexample}
\subsection{Itemization}
One can list items as follows:
\begin{ltgexample}
\begin{itemize}
\item Item One
\item Item Two
\end{itemize}
\end{ltgexample}
\end{document}

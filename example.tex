\begin{abstract}
\emph{Write an abstract for your work. Replace each of the points below with one sentence (two if you must) and you have your abstract. Write it when you finished your entire report.\footnote{https://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/2010/01/how-to-write-a-scientific-abstract-in-six-easy-steps/}}
\emph{Introduction.} In one sentence, what’s the topic? Phrase it in a way that your reader will understand. If you’re writing a PhD thesis, your readers are the examiners – assume they are familiar with the general field of research, so you need to tell them specifically what topic your thesis addresses. Same advice works for scientific papers – the readers are the peer reviewers, and eventually others in your field interested in your research, so again they know the background work, but want to know specifically what topic your paper covers.
\emph{State the problem you tackle.} What’s the key research question? Again, in one sentence. (Note: For a more general essay, I’d adjust this slightly to state the central question that you want to address) Remember, your first sentence introduced the overall topic, so now you can build on that, and focus on one key question within that topic. If you can’t summarize your thesis/paper/essay in one key question, then you don’t yet understand what you’re trying to write about. Keep working at this step until you have a single, concise (and understandable) question.
\emph{Summarize (in one sentence) why nobody else has adequately answered the research question yet.} For a PhD thesis, you’ll have an entire chapter, covering what’s been done previously in the literature. Here you have to boil that down to one sentence. But remember, the trick is not to try and cover all the various ways in which people have tried and failed; the trick is to explain that there’s this one particular approach that nobody else tried yet (hint: it’s the thing that your research does). But here you’re phrasing it in such a way that it’s clear it’s a gap in the literature. So use a phrase such as “previous work has failed to address…”. (if you’re writing a more general essay, you still need to summarize the source material you’re drawing on, so you can pull the same trick – explain in a few words what the general message in the source material is, but expressed in terms of what’s missing)
\emph{Explain, in one sentence, how you tackled the research question.} What’s your big new idea? (Again for a more general essay, you might want to adapt this slightly: what’s the new perspective you have adopted? or: What’s your overall view on the question you introduced in step 2?)
\emph{In one sentence, how did you go about doing the research that follows from your big idea.} Did you run experiments? Build a piece of software? Carry out case studies? This is likely to be the longest sentence, especially if it’s a PhD thesis – after all you’re probably covering several years worth of research. But don’t overdo it – we’re still looking for a sentence that you could read aloud without having to stop for breath. Remember, the word ‘abstract’ means a summary of the main ideas with most of the detail left out. So feel free to omit detail! (For those of you who got this far and are still insisting on writing an essay rather than signing up for a PhD, this sentence is really an elaboration of sentence 4 – explore the consequences of your new perspective).
\emph{As a single sentence, what’s the key impact of your research? Here we’re not looking for the outcome of an experiment.} We’re looking for a summary of the implications. What’s it all mean? Why should other people care? What can they do with your research. (Essay folks: all the same questions apply: what conclusions did you draw, and why would anyone care about them?)
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
\emph{Purpose and scope of your entire report}. The purpose of your entire report is to make a \emph{scientific argument using the scientific method}. A scientific argument always has the following steps that all must come in this order.
\begin{itemize}
    \item[SM1] \emph{Explicate the assumptions and state of the art} on which you are going to conduct your research to investigate your research problem/test the hypothesis.
    \item[SM2] Clearly and precisely \emph{formulate a research problem or hypothesis}.
    \item[SM3] \emph{Describe the (research) method} that you followed to investigate the problem / to test the hypothesis in a way that \emph{allows someone else to reproduce your steps}. The method must includes steps and criteria for evaluating whether you answered your question successfully or not.
    \item[SM4] \emph{Provide execution details} on how you followed the method in the given, specific situation.
    \item[SM5] \emph{Report your results} by describing and summarizing your measurements. You must not interpret your results.
    \item[SM6] \emph{Now interpret your results} by contextualizing the measurements and drawing conclusion that lead to answering your research problem or defining further follow-up research problems.
\end{itemize}
This template will mark various parts of the structure with SM1-SM6 to recall to you which step of a scientific argument is used and where.
\emph{Purpose and scope of \cref{sec:introduction}}. The introduction chapter is a summary of your work and your scientific argument that shall be understandable to anyone in your scientific field, e.g., anyone in Data Science. A reader must be able to comprehend the problem, method, relevant execution details, results, and their interpretation by reading the introduction and the introduction alone. Section~\ref{sec:introduction:topic} introduces the general topic of your research. Section~\ref{sec:introduction:state-of-art} discusses the state of the art and identifies a research. Section~\ref{sec:introduction:research-question} then states the research problem to investigate. Section~\ref{sec:problem-exposition:research-method} explains the research method that was followed, possibly with execution details. Section~\ref{sec:introduction:results} then presents the results and their interpretation. Only if a reader thinks they are not convinced or they need more details to reproduce your study, they shall have to read further. The individual chapters and sections provide the details for each of the steps in your scientific argument.
You usually write the introduction chapter \emph{after} you wrote all other chapters, but you should keep on making notes for each of the sections as you write the later chapters..
\emph{Purpose and scope of the introduction paragraph to a chapter}. The paragraph you are reading above is a typical introductory paragraph to a chapter. It is a high-level summary of the chapters' topic (SM1 and SM2). It gives the reader some guidance by breaking down the chapter topic into subtopics that are clearly named (SM3) in the right order with forward references to the corresponding sections (SM4). It may close with announcing the result you obtain (SM6) but this is usually not done in the opening paragraph of the introduction.
\subsection{Context and Topic (SM1)}\label{sec:introduction:topic}
\emph{Purpose and scope}. You begin with providing the general scientific audience an introduction into the specific topic of your work. The aim of this section is to first introduce the \emph{general subject of study} (``Giraffes are well-known animals and everyone's favorite''), the \emph{specific topic of societal or scientific interest} to investigate (``Giraffes have blue tongues'') and the \emph{objective of society/science towards} this topic (``it is unknown at the moment how the blue color tone evolved'').
It must be understandable by the general scientific public. Every \emph{term} with a specific meaning must be highlighted and introduced in precise language/concepts that only builds on a general scientific background.
At the end of this section, you have explained and established a general goal that society/science universally agrees to be worth achieving (``knowing how everyone's favorite animal evolved the colour of their tongue'').
\subsection{State of the Art (SM1)}\label{sec:introduction:state-of-art}
\emph{Purpose and scope}. You provide a more in-depth introduction into the research topic by contrasting the current state of the art in society/science in relation to the research topic you introduced in \cref{sec:introduction:topic}. This introduction has to
\begin{itemize}
    \item present established facts, methods, and results that provide a deeper understanding of the research topic (``prior work on giraffe genomes, relevance of giraffes for societal well-being, giraffes being a model-animal for various other studies, etc.'')
    \item discuss in which ways prior and recent ideas still fall short of reaching the general goal you explained in \cref{sec:introduction:topic} (``prior work only sequenced the genome of one giraffe and did not consider genes of ancient ancestors'')
\end{itemize}
You have to provide citations/literature references for each of the statements and claims you are making. This section is usually a summary of the related work discussion in \cref{sec:background}.
At the end of this section, you have established a \emph{knowledge gap} between the state of the art and the general objective you developed in \cref{sec:introduction:topic}. \emph{Stating a (knowledge) gap between a status quo and a desired situation is the \emph{first step} of a writing scientific argument.}
\subsection{Research Question (SM2)}\label{sec:introduction:research-question}
\emph{Purpose and scope}. In this section you state in which way you will address the knowledge gap you identified at the end of \cref{sec:introduction:state-of-art}. You usually cannot address and resolve the entire knowledge gap in your work. The purpose of this section is to clearly detail the specific part of the knowledge that you will address. You thereby make all the assumptions explicit that underlie your work (``in this report we focus on genomes of female giraffes who lived in the years 1950-2000 in South Africa'').
Your general research question states
\begin{itemize}
    \item The starting point/assumptions you are making from which your research starts (``for the given 13 genomes of female giraffes...''), and
    \item the final objective/solution you want to reach (``...identify the genes involved in color expression of giraffe tongues...'')
    \item and the evaluation criteria that will determine whether you are successful (``...that are present in at least 75\% of the studied giraffes'')
\end{itemize}
This section contains hints on writing LaTeX.
It focuses on minimal examples, which can be directly adapted to the content
\subsection{Handling of paragraphs}
\begin{ltgexample}
One sentence per line.
This rule is important for the usage of version control systems.
A new line is generated with a blank line.
As you would do in Word:
New paragraphs are generated by pressing enter.
In LaTeX, this does not lead to a new paragraph as LaTeX joins subsequent lines.
In case you want a new paragraph, just press enter twice (!).
This leads to an empty line.
In word, there is the functionality to press shift and enter.
This leads to a hard line break.
The text starts at the beginning of a new line.
In LaTeX, you can do that by using two backslashes (\textbackslash\textbackslash).\\
This is rarely used.
Please do \textit{not} use two backslashes for new paragraphs.
For instance, this sentence belongs to the same paragraph, whereas the last one started a new one.
A long motivation for that is provided at \url{http://loopspace.mathforge.org/HowDidIDoThat/TeX/VCS/#section.3}.
\end{ltgexample}
\subsection{Itemization}
One can list items as follows:
\begin{ltgexample}
\begin{itemize}
\item Item One
\item Item Two
\end{itemize}
\end{ltgexample}
With the package paralist, one can create itemizations with lesser spacing:
\begin{ltgexample}
\begin{compactitem}
\item Item One
\item Item Two
\end{compactitem}
\end{ltgexample}
One can enumerate items as follows:
\begin{ltgexample}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Item One
  \item Item Two
\end{enumerate}
\end{ltgexample}
With the package paralist, one can create enumerations with lesser spacing:
\begin{ltgexample}
\begin{compactenum}
  \item Item One
  \item Item Two
\end{compactenum}
\end{ltgexample}
With paralist, one can even have all items typset after each other and have them clean in the tex document:
\begin{ltgexample}
\begin{inparaenum}
  \item All these items...
  \item ...appear in one line
  \item This is enabled by the paralist package.
\end{inparaenum}
\end{ltgexample}
\subsection{Other Features}
\begin{ltgexample}
The words \enquote{workflow} and \enquote{dwarflike} can be copied from the PDF and pasted to a text file.
\end{ltgexample}
\begin{ltgexample}
The symbol for powerset is now correct: $\powerset$ and not a Weierstrass p ($\wp$).
$\powerset({1,2,3})$
\end{ltgexample}
\begin{ltgexample}
Brackets work as designed:
<test>
One can also input backquotes in verbatim text: \verb|`test`|.
\end{ltgexample}
\end{document}
